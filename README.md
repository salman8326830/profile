Coin Master tips & tricks
YouTube video
Don‚Äôt hoard your coins!
You are always susceptible to a potential Raid taking out a large portion of your held coins. This is why you should always spend coins whenever you‚Äôre able to afford a purchase. This is especially important if you‚Äôre out of Shields or haven‚Äôt unlocked the Rhino Pet yet!

Having a large store of coins in your pocket also makes you a prime target for Big Raids. A Big Raid is a maximum bet Raid that, if successful, can end with the Raider walking away with millions of your Coins!

Big Raids
If you‚Äôve got a ton of Coin Master free spins at your disposal, it can be tempting to want to raise your Bet amount and enjoy the multiplied spin bonus. This is a perfectly viable way of accelerating your Coin earnings. However, it‚Äôs best to save your spins for Raiding very rich players.

Above the Slots Machine, you can see the Coin Master you‚Äôve been assigned as well as their current Coin stores. Save your Bets for Coin Masters with tons of coins. Since the amount of Coin you earn from a Raid is proportional to the amount of Coin the player has on them, by using only Maximum Bets on wealthy Coin Masters, you have the chance of earning a lot of money in a very short time.

If you‚Äôre going for Big Raids, you should always have Foxy equipped as your active Pet. Foxy gives you another shovel to dig with on Raids, so you have an added chance of getting tons of coins.

Buy chests in every village
Individual cards don‚Äôt offer any bonuses but completing a Card Collection does. You should always purchase as many Chests as you can afford when entering a new Village. Lower level Cards become more challenging to obtain as you go up in Village levels, so the early stages are the best places to get the low-level Cards you need to complete a Collection. There‚Äôs no worse feeling than having to spend a Joker to replace the missing standard Card that you could have gotten way back when you first started playing!



Don‚Äôt waste your pet‚Äôs bonuses
The boosting effect of your Pet is only available for four hours after you‚Äôve activated it. If you can‚Äôt play for four hours, you should save activating your Pet until you have a four-hour window you can dedicate to Coin Master.

This even applies to the defensive Rhino; when your base is under siege, he won‚Äôt defend attacks unless you specifically send him out to do so.
